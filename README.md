# Pseudocode Exercise 5 Array

---

## Exercise 1

Find average of list elements.

    Example:
    Input: [1,2,3,4,5] 
    Output: 3


## Exercise 2

Find smallest element in a list.

    Example:
    Input: [1,4,8,10,15]
    Output: 1

    
## Exercise 3

Find index number of highest number. Suppose index starts from 1.

    Example:
    Input: [1,5,9,3,4]
    Output: 3


## Exercise 4

Count how many elements in the array are even numbers.

    Example:
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  
    Output: 3


## Exercise 5 (Challenge)

Input a list of numbers.
Find all the “peaks” — elements that are greater than their neighbors.

    Example:
    Input: [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 6, 2]
    Output: [3, 5]

    Explanation:
    3 > 1 and 2
    5 > 2 and 4
    6 is not counted (since equal neighbor)
